# Self-Host Pro Demo App

A reference implementation demonstrating how to build, version, and distribute self-hosted software using [Self-Host Pro](https://selfhostpro.com).

**While this demo uses Laravel, Self-Host Pro works with any containerized application** — Node.js, Python, Go, Ruby, or any stack that runs in Docker.

## What This Demonstrates

This app showcases the complete workflow for selling self-hosted software:

- **Database Persistence** — SQLite data survives container restarts
- **Version Embedding** — App version injected at build time via `composer.json`
- **Automated Builds** — GitHub Actions builds and pushes to Self-Host Pro's registry
- **Release Strategies** — Edge, pre-release, and stable release workflows

## GitHub Actions Workflows

The CI/CD setup uses a single reusable workflow called by three trigger files. Check out [`.github/workflows/`](.github/workflows/) to see:

| File | Trigger | Tags Produced |
|------|---------|---------------|
| `action_stable-release.yml` | GitHub Release | `latest`, `1.2.0`, `1` |
| `action_prerelease.yml` | GitHub Pre-release | `prerelease`, `prerelease-v1.0.0-beta` |
| `action_edge.yml` | Push to `main` | `edge-main` |
| `service_docker-build-and-publish.yml` | Called by above | (reusable build logic) |

Each trigger workflow is ~20 lines — they just pass different tags to the shared build pipeline. Copy a trigger file to add new release channels like `nightly` or `canary`.

## Local Development with Spin

This project uses [Spin](https://serversideup.net/open-source/spin/) for local Docker development. Spin provides a consistent environment that mirrors production.

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose
- [Spin](https://serversideup.net/open-source/spin/) (`brew install serversideup/tap/spin`)

### Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/selfhostpro/demo-app.git
cd demo-app

# Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Install dependencies
spin run php composer install
spin run node yarn install

# Generate app key and run migrations
spin run php php artisan key:generate
spin run php php artisan migrate

# Seed demo data
spin run php php artisan initialize --force

# Start application servers with Vite
spin up
```

Visit `https://laravel.dev.test` (add to `127.0.0.1 laravel.dev.test` in `/etc/hosts` if needed).

## Docker Setup

The project includes two Dockerfiles:

- **`Dockerfile.php`** — Production PHP image with FrankenPHP
- **`Dockerfile.node`** — Node.js for building frontend assets

### Building for Production

The GitHub Actions workflow handles production builds, but you can build manually:

```bash
# Install dependencies first
spin run php composer install --optimize-autoloader --no-dev
spin run node yarn install && yarn build

# Build the image
docker build -t shpcr.io/yourname/app:latest -f Dockerfile.php .

# Push to Self-Host Pro registry
docker login shpcr.io
docker push shpcr.io/yourname/app:latest
```

```

## Versioning

Set the version in `composer.json` or via environment variable:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

```bash
APP_VERSION=1.0.0
```

The GitHub Actions workflow automatically updates `composer.json` with the release tag version before building.

## Artisan Commands

```bash
# Seed space mission demo data
php artisan initialize [--force]

# Check app status
php artisan status

# Reset to clean state
php artisan reset [--force]
```
